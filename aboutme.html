      <h1>My Story</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is John Dell'Agnese and I live in Nashville, TN. Some of my hobbies include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Listening to old music</li>
        <li>Playing guitar</li>
        <li>Driving</li>
        <li>Trying new restaraunts</li>
        <li>Going to waterparks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are lots of other hobbies I have and things I enjoy doing, but as a person I'd say I'm an outgoing<br> and charasmatic guy who likes to get to know others.
      And that's pretty much it really. I'm glad to be apart<br> of this career change and learning path with you all!<br>

      <h2>Why I Chose Coding</h2>
      <p>I landed with wanting to become a coder/programmer after working in the retail industry and the<br>
      restaraunt business for about 7 years. I decided I wanted something with better pay and a job that was<br> more dependable, and that's
      where I discovered the opportunites that came with learning how to code.<br></p>
